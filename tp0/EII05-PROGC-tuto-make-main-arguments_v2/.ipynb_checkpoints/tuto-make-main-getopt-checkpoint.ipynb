    "**make** is old. It is still often used to install simple third party librairies, for example for github. However its successors **cmake** or **autotools** are easier to use to describe a large project that can deploy on several systems. They rely on the same principles: identify targets and dependencies, apply the relevant commands when necessary. They will generate the Makefile adapted to your system."
